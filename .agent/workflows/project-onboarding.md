# Project Context

Whenever you are asked to start working on `eagleliz` or execute tasks without specific context, **always read `AI_CONTEXT.md` located in the root directory first**.

1. Use the read tool on `/Users/gabliz/Developer/eagleliz/AI_CONTEXT.md`
2. Familiarize yourself with the library usage (`typer`, `pylizlib`) before making code modifications.
3. If creating a new command, place it in `eagleliz/` and ensure it's registered with the `eagleliz_app` in `eagleliz/__init__.py` or where `PylizApp` instances gather commands.
